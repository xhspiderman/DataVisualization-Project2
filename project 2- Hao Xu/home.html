		<h2>US Imports/Exports Visualization</h2>
		<h3>Authors: Anthony Xu & Hao Xu</h3>
		<p>The goal of this project is to present interesting and useful visualizations 
		for US imports and exports with information from the US Census. It makes use of 
		different Google Visualizations to provide interactive charts and tables. A 
		walkthrough of the features of the visualizations are below. We hope you enjoy 
		using it and find some interesting information</p>
		<img src="img/top25ie.png">
		<p>When the page is first loaded you can see the page navigation functions at the 
		top of the page. Click one of them to view different types of information. The 
		first thing you see is a table and pie chart of the top 25 imports of 2013. You 
		can use the toggles for year and import/export to view different information.</p>
		<img src="img/top25iehover.png">
		<p>The pie chart shows the same information, but in a graphic view. Here, the most 
		imported/exported commodities are represented by a greater percentage of the pie. 
		Hover over any of the slices to view the commodity represented by each slice.</p>
		<img src="img/ieUSMap.png">
		<p>The next type of information shown is the import/export information for specific 
		commodities. You can see a map of the US with the colors representing a higher 
		amount of commodities (in millions of dollars)imported or exported by state. 
		Hover over a state to view the exact amount. You can also click on a state which 
		will update the rest of the charts.</p>
		<img src="img/ieHoverPie.png">
		<p>This pie chart shows the top 25 imports or exports for that state. Hover over 
		any of the slices to view the commodity represented by each slice. Clicking on 
		any of these slices updates both the column chart on the right and the two tables 
		underneath with information for that commodity. The column chart shows the amount 
		of imports or exports for that commodity by year. The left table on the bottom 
		shows the other states which imported that specific commodity. The right table on 
		shows the other states which imported that specific commodity.</p>
		<img src="img/ieExportToggle.png">
		<p>Just like the top visualization, you can toggle between the years and 
		import/export to view more information.</p>
		<img src="img/ieTable.png">
		<p>You can also view this information as a table, if you prefer, by choosing the 
		"Table" toggle.</p>
		<img src="img/countryUSMap.png">
		<p>The last set of visualizations looks similar to the previous one, but shows 
		the countries with which a state imports and exports with. The US chart shows the 
		states with the highest amount of imports/exports. Again you can click on a state 
		which will update the rest of the charts with information for that specific 
		state.<p>
		<img src="img/countryUpdateTables.png">
		<p>The pie chart will update with the countries with which a state imports and 
		exports the most as a larger piece of the pie. You can hover to view more 
		information or click to update the column chart and the two tables 
		underneath with more information for that country.</p>
		<img src="img/countryWorldMap.png">
		<p>There is one more view for this information which is a world map. View this 
		map by clicking on the "World Map" toggle. Similar to the US map, countries with 
		a higher number of imports or exports is represented by a darker color.</p>
